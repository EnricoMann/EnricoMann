# 👋 Hey, I'm Enrico Mann

**Software Engineer** based in Barcelona 🇪🇸  
Focused on building **scalable, data‑driven systems** using **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **FastAPI**.  
I work at the intersection of **backend architecture**, **automation**, and **AI integration** — from data pipelines to user‑facing applications.

---

### 🧠 About Me
I’m passionate about designing systems that are elegant under pressure — maintainable, fast, and explainable.  
My work blends backend engineering, automation workflows, and AI models into real products that solve problems with measurable impact.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually analyzing data, experimenting with LLM integrations, or optimizing development workflows with Docker and Redis.
