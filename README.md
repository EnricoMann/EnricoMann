###  My Featured Projects

####  [AI Verifier](https://github.com/EnricoMann/AI-Verifier)
Local **AI-powered fact-checking app** that analyzes online claims using **Ollama (Llama 3)** and trusted APIs like **Google Fact Check**, **Snopes**, **PolitiFact**, and **AFP Fact Check**.  
Built with **FastAPI**, **Next.js 14**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Docker**, combining **AI reasoning** with **verified data sources**.  
Inspired by my earlier project at *Ação da Cidadania* focused on combating misinformation.

####  [DataNarrator](https://github.com/EnricoMann/datanarrator)
AI-powered data analysis platform that lets users upload CSVs and automatically generate insights, charts, and PDF reports using LLM reasoning.  
Built with **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, and **Docker**, integrating **Ollama (Llama 3)** for on-device AI processing.  
Demonstrates **data pipeline design**, **API orchestration**, and **scalable architecture**.

####  [InsightRelay](https://github.com/EnricoMann/InsightRelay)
Distributed trending intelligence dashboard aggregating developer content from **Hacker News**, **GitHub**, and **Dev.to** in real time.  
Built a multi-service system with **Node.js**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, and **BullMQ**, visualized via **Next.js**.  
Focus on **distributed job queues**, **real-time analytics**, and **system orchestration**.
